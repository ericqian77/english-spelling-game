# Comprehensive English Spelling Game for Children - Full Stack Application

## Project Overview

Create an engaging and educational full-stack application for a spelling game designed to help children practice English words. The application will feature a React frontend for an interactive user experience and a FastAPI backend for robust game logic and data management. The entire application will be optimized for deployment on the Replit platform.

## Key Features

1. Interactive 3x3 word grid
2. Theme-based word sets
3. Real-time word verification
4. Hint system with attempt points
5. Celebratory animations for correct answers
6. Game session tracking and statistics

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Deployment: Replit

## Detailed Component Descriptions

### Frontend (React)

1. Main Components:
   - `SpellingGame`: The primary game component
   - `WordGrid`: 3x3 grid to display revealed words
   - `InputArea`: For word entry and submission
   - `HintButton`: To request hints
   - `GameStats`: Display attempts and hint points
   - `CelebrationAnimation`: For correct word animations

2. User Interface:
   - Clean, child-friendly design
   - Responsive layout for various devices
   - Clear display of current theme and game progress
   - Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers
   - Animated transitions for revealed words

3. Game Flow:
   - Fetch new game data from backend
   - Handle user input and submission
   - Request and display hints
   - Trigger animations for correct answers
   - Display game over summary

4. State Management:
   - Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
   - Implement context or Redux if complexity increases

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. API Endpoints:
   - `GET /api/new-game`: Initialize a new game session
   - `POST /api/check-word`: Verify user's spelling attempt
   - `GET /api/game-status`: Retrieve current game status
   - `POST /api/get-hint`: Provide a hint for the current word

2. Game Logic:
   - Random theme and word selection
   - Word verification
   - Hint generation
   - Game progress tracking
   - Session management

3. Data Models (using Pydantic):
   - `Theme`: Represent word themes
   - `Game`: Represent active game sessions
   - `WordAttempt`: Represent individual word attempts

4. Database Operations:
   - CRUD operations for themes and games
   - Efficient querying and updating of game states

### Data Storage (SQLite with SQLAlchemy)

1. Database Schema:
   ```python
   class Theme(Base):
       __tablename__ = "themes"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       name = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
       words = Column(String)  # JSON string of words

   class Game(Base):
       __tablename__ = "games"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
       user_id = Column(String, index=True)
       theme = Column(String)
       words = Column(String)  # JSON string of game words
       attempts = Column(Integer)
       hint_points = Column(Integer, default=9)
       start_time = Column(DateTime)
       end_time = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
   ```

2. Data Access Layer:
   - Implement repository pattern for database operations
   - Include methods for game initialization, updates, and retrieval

### Hint System

1. Implementation:
   - Users can spend 3 hint points to reveal the first two letters of a word
   - Backend tracks and updates hint points
   - Frontend displays available hint points and handles hint requests

2. Hint Request Flow:
   - Frontend sends request to `/api/get-hint`
   - Backend verifies hint points, deducts points, and returns hint
   - Frontend displays hint and updates remaining points

### Celebration Animations

1. Implementation:
   - Use libraries like `react-confetti` or `react-fireworks`
   - Trigger animations on successful word completion
   - Customize animation style and duration

2. Animation Trigger:
   - Backend sends "correct word" flag in response
   - Frontend initiates animation based on this flag

## Replit-Specific Considerations

1. Environment Setup:
   - Utilize Replit's built-in SQLite database
   - Store sensitive information in Replit Secrets

2. Deployment:
   - Configure for Replit's always-on feature
   - Set up run command to start both frontend and backend

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for heavy components (e.g., animation libraries)
   - Optimize asset loading and management

4. Frontend Serving:
   - Serve React frontend using FastAPI's static file serving

## Security Considerations

1. Implement proper CORS settings in FastAPI
2. Use Replit Secrets for sensitive data
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
4. Sanitize and validate all user inputs using Pydantic models

## Future Enhancements

1. User authentication and profiles
2. Multiple difficulty levels
3. Leaderboards and achievements
4. Multiplayer mode
5. Enhanced analytics for learning progress
6. Customizable themes and animations

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow modular design principles for both frontend and backend
2. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
4. Develop with scalability in mind for future feature additions
5. Regularly test on Replit to ensure compatibility

## Prompt for AI-Assisted Development

"Create a full-stack educational spelling game application for children using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, optimized for deployment on Replit. The game should feature a 3x3 word grid, theme-based word sets, real-time word verification, a hint system using attempt points, and celebratory animations for correct answers. 

Implement the frontend with React, including components for the game board, word input, hint button, and game statistics. Use React hooks for state management and integrate animation libraries for celebrations.

Develop the backend with FastAPI, creating endpoints for game initialization, word checking, hint provision, and game status updates. Implement game logic for word selection, verification, and hint generation. Use SQLite with SQLAlchemy for data storage, creating models for themes and game sessions.

Include a hint system where users can spend 3 attempt points to reveal the first two letters of a word. Implement celebratory animations (like confetti or fireworks) when a word is correctly spelled.

Optimize the application for Replit, utilizing its built-in SQLite database and Secrets for configuration. Ensure the application is secure, implementing proper CORS settings, input validation, and rate limiting.

Provide clear documentation and code comments throughout the project. Design the system with future enhancements in mind, such as user profiles, difficulty levels, and multiplayer functionality.

Remember to keep the user interface child-friendly, engaging, and responsive to different devices."
